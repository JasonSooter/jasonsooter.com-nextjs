> ALPHACAM's Reverse-Side Nesting Helps The Organic Bloom Produce Custom Picture Frames

Tucked inside a small industrial park in Tulsa, Oklahoma, The Organic Bloom is
disguized as an ordinary woodshop. Stroll beyond the subdued exterior, however,
and within you'll find a product that could grace the pages of any home décor
magazine.

Brightly colored picture frames in a range of colors, shapes and sizes are
displayed in all stages of development. Some are stacked and await painting,
while others are drying or finished and ready to ship. It's a lot like Santa's
workshop, minus the elves.

“You can go to Home Depot or Target to get your frames, but you can't get them
in the color or size, or even the shape, that you want,” says Jason Sooter,
founder and owner of The Organic Bloom.

Sooter's company, which manufactures a wide range of frames for Professional
Portrait Photographers, has filled a niche by making a single, unique product
and specializing in its customization. While some of its frames are cut with
straight profiles, most feature various levels of curvature and a decidedly
designer touch.

> We have hundreds of different frames. We do very customized products, so
> people go to our website and choose the shape and color from a bunch of
> different sizes, to really customize their order for their space. —Tim
> Summerer, Director of Production.

With 16 styles, 48 sizes, and 53 colors from which to choose, the combinations
make for tremendous customization potential.

To turn out a batch of about 100 custom frames each day, The Organic Bloom
utilizes powerful machinery and the ALPHACAM Computer-Aided-Manufacturing (CAM)
solution by Vero Software.

The company, which employs a crew of 30, replaced its previous CAM software
about 16 months ago, upon discovering that it couldn't deliver automated quality
and consistency. Ultimately, the software was unable to take the company to the
next level.

Sooter and Summerer find that ALPHACAM has become a vital component for
programming the company's new Weeke 5' X 10' CNC router.

“We bought some new machinery and needed updated software,” Summerer says.
“ALPHACAM was able to fulfill a lot of our needs.”

### All in a Day's Work

The Organic Bloom cuts about 33,000 square inches of medium-density fiberboard
(MDF) each day. The shop deals in square inches in lieu of the standard square
feet to maintain product consistency, as its frames typically range on the
smaller scale.

A day's batch typically consists of several pages of a variety of products, in
orders of virtually any number — from one, two, five, or more. While the product
itself is a fairly predictable factor, demands fluctuate daily and the company
doesn't stock up on finished products because of their inherently unique nature.

As part of its customization menu, The Organic Bloom offers single frames and
double frames, which feature inner profiles that either complement or duplicate
the outer profiles. Because of the flexibility necessary for customization, the
company needed CAM software as flexible as its frames.

> With so many products — we have just thousands of combinations — ALPHACAM
> makes it easy to edit and modify our designs as needed. — Tim Summerer

Once a day's orders have been entered into the system, ALPHACAM takes all of the
frames, applies tooling, and automatically nests the parts to save both time and
material. The reverse-side nesting engine in ALPHACAM allows the company to
accurately cut both sides of the MDF, and factors heavily in the company's
efficiency.

> Reverse-side nesting creates a front side and a back side for each frame. The
> post processor sends that to our machine and the operator cuts the back side
> first, and then flips it and does the front side — Tim Summerer

ALPHACAM's nesting functionality includes the option for fixed orientation in
cases where the direction of the grain is a factor. It also supports tool
lead-in and lead-out, as well as multiple-depth parts that may require onion
skins.

“Reverse-side nesting opened possibilities we weren't doing before,” Sooter
says. “ALPHACAM, along with our new machine, made something possible that isn't
easily possible otherwise. This feature should change the way people think about
what they are cutting, as it improved our product tremendously.”

With the combination of the Weeke CNC Router and ALPHACAM, The Organic Bloom is
also able to achieve paper-thin, seamless MDF folds required for special
projects.

Sooter and Summerer credit the combination of software and machinery for their
success in reverse-side nesting and the ability to consistently produce
high-quality products.

“Our new machinery allows us to machine on both sides of the sheet,” Summerer
says. “We have great precision and the ability to line up the sheet in the same
place, so we can flip it. ALPHACAM was able to help us out with that.”

While the company doesn't keep a ready product inventory, it does round out its
nesting potential for each batch by manually adding or subtracting “filler
parts.”

The company, which initially began with 10 styles, has found a way to offer
customers countless options while increasing efficiency. Prior to its
acquisition of ALPHACAM, which programs the machinery to cut keyholes into the
back sides of standard frames, employees manually attached mounting hardware.
This was time consuming and created an inconsistent product.

The software's reverse-side nesting capability comes in especially handy for the
production of custom iPad frames, which feature several holes for access to
device controls, as well as dowel holes that allow the frames to stand on
tabletops.

> We found that ALPHACAM had enough power and variety to take on a bunch of
> different projects,” — Tim Summerer

### Success Blooms, Organically

With nearly 75,000 “Fans” on Facebook, The Organic Bloom has reached a kind of
rock-star status perhaps surprising for a woodshop born of fortunate
happenstance and an awful lot of hard work.

The roots of this organic bloom were, well, actually quite organic.

As Sooter tells it, he'd bought a simple Shopbot router from Craigslist about
four years ago, when he was asked by a photographer friend to cut a frame. The
results of his efforts were subsequently advertized on Facebook and — voilà — he
had a business that struggled to handle all of its sudden demand. “It was just
craziness,” Sooter says, “For all of 2011 and 2012, every month was bigger than
the last.”

With ALPHACAM and their new machinery, Sooter and Summerer are prepared to meet
new developments in frame design. A visit to the company's website reveals not
only a knack for making and marketing a one-of-a-kind product, but for taking it
as far as it can go.
